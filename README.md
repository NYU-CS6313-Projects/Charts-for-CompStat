# Charts-for-CompStat

This is an ongoing project aims to enhance the NYPD performance analysis by developing a web-based interactive visualization tool that communicates not only [traditional aggregation statistics] (http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_statistics.shtml), but one that would reveal hidden events in the data. The visualization idiom is an interactive PDF which provides better opportunities for data presentation and exploration, while delicately moving away from the familiar and well-trusted format of PDF reports widely used by NYPD. An open [dataset] (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95) on Motor Vehicle Collisions published by the NYPD is used as a case study.

The visualization tool can be found [here] (http://nyu-cs6313-projects.github.io/Charts-for-CompStat/).

A live demo can be found [here] (https://vimeo.com/128094712).
